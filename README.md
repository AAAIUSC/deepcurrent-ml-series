## Jupyter Notebooks for AAAI@USC Deepcurrent Hands-On ML Series

Throughout this series, we will be working with a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/) to make predictions about taxi fares in New York City. We will be providing an introduction to various [Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) algorithms and using several Python libraries for [data preparation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_preparation), [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis), [data visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization), and [predictive analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics). 

### Prequisites:
Prior programming knowledge, especially in [Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp), is highly recommended.

### Setup:
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/)

[Install Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)
