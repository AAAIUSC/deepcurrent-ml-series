## Jupyter Notebooks for AAAI@USC Deepcurrent Hands-On ML Series

Throughout this series, we will be working with a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/) to make predictions about taxi fares in New York City. We will be providing an introduction to various Machine Learning algorithms and using several Python libraries for data preparation, data analysis, data visualization, and predictive analytics. 

### Prequisites:
Prior programming knowledge, especially in Python, is highly recommended.

### Setup:
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/)
[Install Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)
